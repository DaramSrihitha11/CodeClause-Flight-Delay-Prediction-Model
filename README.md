# CodeClause-Flight-Delay-Prediction-Model
## Summary :
The Flight Delay Prediction Model implemented in Google Colab uses historical flight data to predict whether a flight will experience delays. Here is a summary of the model:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The provided flight data is preprocessed to prepare it for training the model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected from the dataset based on their potential impact on flight delays. These features may include the day of the month, day of the week, airline carrier, origin and destination airports, and other relevant information.

3. **Model Training:** The selected features and corresponding flight delay labels are used to train a machine learning model. Various algorithms can be applied, such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to learn patterns and relationships between the features and flight delays.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance in predicting flight delays. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model's performance is compared to baseline models or industry standards to determine its effectiveness.

5. **Model Deployment:** Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions on new flight data. This can be integrated into an application or system to provide users with timely information about potential flight delays.

6. **Improvement Iterations:** The model's performance can be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters, incorporating additional features, or exploring advanced techniques such as ensemble learning or neural networks. Iterative improvements are made to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

Overall, the Flight Delay Prediction Model implemented in Google Colab enables the prediction of flight delays based on historical flight data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model can provide valuable insights to airlines, passengers, and other stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions and mitigate the impact of flight delays.
